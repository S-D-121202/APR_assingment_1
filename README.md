This code is a linear regression model, it is a multivariate linear regressor.
meaning: It is taking more than 1 variable as input and predicting output value.
the problem statement: various parameters are being provided, the aim is to predict the price of house based on these parameters.
note : various non numeric parameters are also present in the training and testing file, the code simply drops those non numeric parameters and does the prediction based on only numeric data.
1st this code perform training on training data with 0.2 fraction split for validation data.
then it performs actual prediction on testing dataset.
note: all the trying and testing datasets are taken from kaggle.
